					<h4>What does this site do?</h4>
					<p>This site provides an animated visualization of the station location of JT65 / JT9 signals 
					transmitted and received by Amateur Radio operators over time. I built this site to
					look at propagation patterns change, to visually see the location of
					stations I have received as an approximate indication of how propagation paths
					change over time.</p>

					<h4>How accurate is this for predicting propagation conditions?</h4>
					<p>The display of received stations can only display stations based on data you
					or other operators upload, and the stations received during the time
					period that you or the other stations were actively receiving. </p>
					<p>For best results therefore, data received over a longer period of time (multiple
					hours) is going to be more interesting to visualize that data received over
					a relatively short period of time like 15 minutes. </p>
					<p>This visualization is completely dependent on remote stations transmitting
					over a period of time. For example, if you receive station A transmitting
					over a 10 minute period but then their transmissions stop, this doesn't necessarily
					mean that the propagation path to that station has closed, because they may
					have just turned off their radio. Even still, receiving stations from a general location
					is a positive indication that a path is (or was) open to that location, and so
					is still interesting to see on a map over time how this may change.</p>

					<p>You can upload your own log data for

					<h4>Isn't this similar to what PSKReporter already does?</h4>
					<p>PSKReporter is an excellent site and provides great visibility into signals transmitted
					or received by a callsign or gridsquare. This site differs by allowing you to 
					see the received signals <i>replayed back over a period of time</i>. It allows
					you to ask questions like: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>"What signals did I receive between 9am and 6pm today, and
					where were those stations located?"</li>
					<li>"Where were the majority of stations that I received this morning located, and 
					how did the propagation conditions change between this morning and this evening?"</li>
					</ul>
