		<h3>How to Log a Bug or Feature Enhancement</h3>
		<p>
		This site is functional (and hopefully interesting/useful!) but is still a work
		in progress and if something is not working, or if you'd like to suggest an 
		enhancement, I'd love to hear from you!
		</p>
		
		<p>You can log a bug ticket or enhancement request on the Issue Tracker page for
		the project page <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/kevinhooke/SpotViz/issues">
		on GitHub here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>To log a bug or enhancement request for the log file uploader, use the Issue Tracker
		<a target="_new" href="https://github.com/kevinhooke/WSJTLogParser/issues">on GitHub here.</p>
