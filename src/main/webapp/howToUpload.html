		<h3>How to Upload Your WSJT-X Data Files for Visualization</h3>
		<p>To upload your data fies, you need to download and run the
			uploader.</p>
		<h4>Pre-reqs:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The uploader requires Java SE 8. Download from here
				<a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_new">
				http://www.java.com/en/</a> if you don't already have installed.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h4>Download:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Download SpotvizLogUploader-1.0.jar from the release page:
				<a href="https://github.com/kevinhooke/WSJTLogParser/releases/tag/1.0" target="_new">
				https://github.com/kevinhooke/WSJTLogParser/releases/tag/1.0</a></li>
			<li>Save the downloaded jar to a folder locally</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>To run:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Start a command prompt/shell/terminal, and from the command
				line cd into the folder containing the downloaded jar and then type:</li>
		</ul>
		<code> java -jar SpotvizLogUploader-1.0.jar --callsign
			YOUR_CALL --file /PATH/TO/WSJT-X/ALL.TXT </code>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>Where:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>YOUR_CALL is your callsign - this will be used to store your
				uploaded data against, so when searching for your call 
				you can find your uploaded data.</li>
				<li>/PATH/TO/WSJT-X/ALL.TXT is the path to WSJT's ALL.TXT file (see
				below for example locations depending on your platform.</li> 
		</ul>

		<p>The parser runs once a minute on the minute to sync with new
			spots being logged to WSJT-X's ALL.TXT file. If you leave it running,
			it will continue to watch the file for new updates and upload them
			every minute. Otherwise you can run it one time, leave for a minute
			to ensure it runs, and then Ctrl-C to end it.</p>

		<h4>Path to WSJT-X ALL.TXT file</h4>
		<p>Depending on the version of WSJT-X and the operating system you
			are running on, your ALL.TXT data file will be in one of the
			following locations:</p>
